# disease_prediction_system
I created a machine learning-based method for symptom-based disease diagnosis in this study. By combining Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest  classifiers, the study aimed to predict diseases reliably.
The classifiers were trained using a dataset that included disease diagnoses and symptom information.
The accuracy of each classifier is evaluated on a testing dataset and how PCA  affected the results.
Reducing the PCA components further affected the results continuously, for judging the reliability of  the symptoms I addressed a few medical professionals, and concluded that  maximum accuracy and reliability was achieved between components 45-50.
